"""Derived principal stresses from physically resolved symmetric stress tensors.

The shared measure formulas live in :mod:`anysolver_results.formulas` so the
solver's reviewed derived measures and the offline capsule runtime compute
identical values from one source; this module re-exports them for the
solver's internal callers.
