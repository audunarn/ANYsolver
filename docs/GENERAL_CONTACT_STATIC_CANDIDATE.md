# General-contact static candidate: supported entrypoints and run guide

Updated 2026-10-20. This page describes the **measured opt-in guided static
contact candidate** delivered on 2026-10-19 and its supported public
entrypoints, examples and restart/archive workflows. It is a usability guide,
not a qualification claim: full C0-C9/D0-D8 qualification, capability
admission and released/admitted flags remain unchanged and false. Start with
[the durable status/restart handoff](GENERAL_CONTACT_CANDIDATE_HANDOFF_20261019.md)
for the measured evidence, artifact hashes and consumed allowances.

## Scope

Supported, measured opt-in routes (the W1-W10 delivery workflows):

- elastic S3 normal contact against rigid tools: the S3 plane and finite
  planar triangulated rigid tools (round beam profiles remain a separate
  route and are not part of this measured claim);
- guided deformable shell-pair normal contact with explicit physical sides,
  including the automatic physical-side pair;
- material-anchor Coulomb stick/slip friction with reversal, press/open/
  recontact, checkpoint restart and rollback;
- detached public static result archives with integrity checks and corruption
  refusal.

Not supported outside that guided scope: general/automatic shell-shell,
body-body, rolling or self-contact, target bending in the friction example,
finite-rotation contact, swept friction, and any admission claim. The
rigid-sphere frictionless impact route documented on the README impact/contact
line is a distinct route and remains frictionless.

## Public entrypoints

All entrypoints live in the `anysolver.general_contact` package and load
lazily; ordinary no-contact solves never import the contact kernel.

```python
from anysolver.general_contact import (
    ContactDefinition, ContactInteraction, ContactSurface,
    ContactSolverSettings, ContactPathControl, ContactPathProgram,
    S3SlidingFrictionSettings,
    solve_static_contact_path,
    read_static_contact_results,
)
```

`S3SlidingFrictionSettings` is the base friction settings class (its
specialized subclasses remain exported too). Construct it with keywords:

```python
friction = S3SlidingFrictionSettings(
    friction_coefficient=0.3,
    tangential_stiffness_Pa_per_m=1000.0,
    steps_by_dof=(2e-7,) * model.mesh.dof_manager.total_dofs,
    maximum_candidate_evaluations=145,
)
```

`steps_by_dof` needs exactly one positive finite-difference step per model
DOF; take the vector length from `model.mesh.dof_manager.total_dofs`. The
measured candidate used the 2e-7 probe step and the 145 evaluation cap shown
above; changing them is allowed by validation but departs from the measured
settings.

## Installation

Two supported routes:

1. **Current candidate bundle** (recommended for evaluation):
   `C:/ANYworkspaceWork/contact-incremental-delivery-20261020/slice3/ANYsolver-contact-candidate-20261020-s3.zip`.
   The extracted bundle ROOT contains `examples/` and a `wheelhouse/` with
   the six pure-Python private wheels (ANYsolver, ANYresults, ANYmaterial,
   ANYgeometry, ANYmesher, ANYfileio). From the bundle ROOT, in a fresh
   virtual environment:

   ```text
   python -m pip install --find-links wheelhouse -r requirements-tested.txt "ANYsolver[general-contact]==0.4.7+contact.candidate.20261020.s2" "ANYsolver-results==2.1.1" "ANYmaterial==0.2.0" "ANYgeometry[planar]==0.4.3" "ANYmesher==0.5.0" "ANYfileio==0.3.2"
   ```

   Numeric and Shapely dependencies resolve normally from their usual
   indexes; the bundle is not offline unless separately provided. The
   original 2026-10-19 bundle remains an immutable historical artifact whose
   claims apply to it alone; for evaluation it is superseded by the bundle
   above.
2. **Repository source** (development): install this repository's source
   package with its declared dependency closure and run the `examples/`
   scripts below from the repository root.

## Run guide

From the repository root, or the extracted bundle ROOT containing
`examples/`:

- Normal rigid-tool contact:
  `python -m examples.general_contact_s3_plane`,
  `python -m examples.general_contact_triangulated_rigid`.
- Round beam profile (separate route, not part of the measured S3
  rigid-tool claim): `python -m examples.general_contact_round_beam_plane`.
- Automatic physical-side shell pair:
  `python -m examples.general_contact_automatic_s3_pair` and
  `python -m examples.general_contact_s3_physical_orientation`.
- Friction with restart and rollback. A partial run writes a restart
  checkpoint inside its output JSON; the restart recipe is (each command on
  its own line):

  ```text
  python -m examples.general_contact_s3_friction_physical_path --through-step 3 --output partial.json
  python -c "import json; from pathlib import Path; Path('checkpoint.json').write_text(json.dumps(json.loads(Path('partial.json').read_text())['checkpoint']))"
  python -m examples.general_contact_s3_friction_physical_path --through-step 7 --restart checkpoint.json --output completed.json
  ```
- Static result archive (export and detached read):
  `python -m examples.general_contact_static_results_archive`.

## Failure, retained state and restart

Use `result.status == "completed"` to decide whether the requested target
finished. Gap rejection reports `contact_gap_exceeded`; exhausted stepping
after acceptance reports `stopped_at_limit`. Failure and iteration-level
reasons describe the actual cause. A retained step may have `converged=True`
while the overall target remains incomplete.

Rejected trials retain the last accepted displacement and material history.
Cancellation discards trial state and permits a fresh solve on the same
model. Checkpoint continuation requires a **completed prefix target**: keep
that checkpoint before further loading. A checkpoint from a terminally failed
solve preserves state for inspection but is refused for direct continuation.
This existing restriction is unchanged; the commands above use a completed prefix.

## Measured settings strings

The candidate was measured with exactly these settings strings and values:
`general_s3_differentiation='jet2_s3_dev'` with difference step 2e-5,
`path_predictor='control_projection_dev'`,
`shell_pair_orientation='physical_sides_dev'`, projected-penalty normal law
with penalty 1000. and gap limit 5e-5, and the friction settings above.
These historical development-profile names are used by the selected measured
examples. The suffix alone establishes neither measured coverage nor
qualification; only the listed workflows have the stated evidence.

## Limitations

- Agreement claims are for the declared finite-penalty law and chosen
  geometry, not continuum or mesh/model error estimates.
- Windows and Ubuntu Python 3.12 cold installs of the same six wheels passed on 2026-10-20: exact package origins, 20 selected assertions per host, normal/friction/archive commands, transferred active/open restart and all 29 cross-host comparison entries. See the handoff for dimensional bounds and measured differences. Full qualification and unrelated full-CI failures remain open.
- The 2026-10-19 measurements remain same-host Windows historical evidence.
- Capability/released/admitted flags are unchanged; nothing on this page
  admits the candidate into qualified production scope.
