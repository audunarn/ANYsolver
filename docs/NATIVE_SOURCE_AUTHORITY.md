# Optional native source-authority guard

CPython 3.11 on Windows x64 can build a private C++17 metadata comparator with
the normal setuptools backend and an installed MSVC toolchain. No NumPy or
SciPy code is included in this extension. Its version-specific wheel does not
claim a stable Python ABI. Missing compilers are optional build failures;
unsupported Python/platform combinations retain the complete Python guard.
`ANYSOLVER_BUILD_NATIVE_GUARD=0` produces the comparison pure build, and
`ANYSOLVER_NATIVE_GUARD=python` selects the literal guard at process startup.

The native plan owns only original expected facts. Every existing native safe
point still checks all 18 class records and 1274 helper records plus the matcher
bootstrap. Class/MRO namespace order, callable metadata, globals, closures,
empty cells and the exact integer generation-counter exception retain their
literal meaning. Comparison memos and current grammar inspection are discarded
after each guard. Unknown grammar or any predicate mismatch runs the complete
literal guard; it does not supply a new rejection or a successful proof.

Admission checks exact module-owned C builtin entries before calling any
module-supplied proof API. It binds their immutable method definitions and
actual mapped Windows binary to the installed wheel RECORD and packaged C++
source digest. Later Python binding/owner changes refuse after the original
class checks, preserving class-failure priority. This does not promise protection
against arbitrary native memory corruption. File hashing occurs at admission,
not at each tile. Unrelated unsupported dictionary keys take literal fallback
without executing their custom hash/equality behavior.
Editable/source installations without a recorded binary use complete Python
fallback, even if an in-place extension exists. Recorded binary mismatches,
source mismatches and entry tamper retain refusal; missing metadata never
establishes a native proof. The effective backend is available in private
guard diagnostics.

The admission digest reads the file at the Windows-reported mapped path; it is
not a digest of live PE image sections. Local rename/replacement between loading
and hashing remains a residual filesystem/image identity limitation. Captured
C entry and method-definition references remain fixed after admission. There
is no per-guard file hashing and no claim to detect arbitrary native memory
corruption.

The bounded 129-element, 20-pattern, 16-case comparison retained the actual
E4808 native refusal, 128 qualified elements, 2048 original qualified GEMVs and
16 native recoveries. Both backends matched 224 fields / 41280 float64 words,
14 associations, 16 case records and six geometry arrays against the original
archive. The saved profiled exports measured 2.3456045 s for literal fallback
and 1.0563650 s for the native guard. These are small profiled development runs,
not throughput, physical-scale acceptance or release evidence. Full-scale and
independent review gates remain separate.

### Cold immutable code grammar (prospective candidate)

The native plan may strongly own exact CPython CodeType objects after their
complete recursive stock constants, byte tables and name metadata pass cold
preflight. Warm guards reuse only that immutable grammar classification by
object identity. Each current function code binding, defaults, keyword defaults,
closure, globals, class namespace and routing fact is still checked freshly.
A replaced code object takes complete preflight; unsupported metadata retains
the original literal fallback. No current proof survives a guard invocation.
The code references participate in plan GC traversal. This is a source guard
implementation change, with no numerical or eligibility change. OpenAI retains
this connected slice because Mistral is unavailable and user-forbidden.
