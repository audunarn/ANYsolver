# Independent static load histories

`iter_linear_batches` solves arbitrary ordered `StaticCase` records against one
unchanged model. Each case has its own `LoadCase`; `time` is an optional label,
not an interpolation parameter or a proportional-load assumption. The iterator
defaults to blocks of at most 32 cases. Existing `solve_linear` and
`solve_linear_many` return types remain unchanged.

```

The complete scripts [supported history](../examples/static_batch_supported.py)
and [free-free history](../examples/static_batch_free_free.py) print selected
responses, per-case gauge diagnostics and governing envelope records. From a
source checkout in PowerShell, run:

```powershell
$env:PYTHONPATH = (Resolve-Path src).Path
python examples/static_batch_supported.py
python examples/static_batch_free_free.py
python examples/static_batch_free_free.py --include-failure
python examples/static_batch_free_free.py --disconnected-control
```

The free-free fixture combines independent balanced axial and torsional patterns
at irregular times. Its failure controls retain previously certified envelopes
with `complete=False`. A disconnected free-free model requires balance on every
component; global resultant balance alone is insufficient. The disconnected
control applies equal/opposite forces to different components and demonstrates
that refusal. The default physical route does not introduce balancing reactions
to make an incompatible load admissible.

Each `StaticBatch` carries input indices, case IDs, times, output DOF order,
a displacement matrix with one column per case, per-case recovery dictionaries,
and diagnostics. Cases are assembled independently. Exact plain builtin loads
are copied when observed, so a generator may reuse and update one mutable load
object. Other load providers are assembled immediately before requesting the
next input. They are never evaluated again to identify a failure.

The session retains a prepared scaled supported operator or a distinct augmented
free-free operator using its bounded factorization cache. Selected displacement
rows use the existing affine output plan. Stress recovery uses the existing
public recovery path, including qualified batching and scalar fallbacks. Stress
or reaction requests currently reconstruct a full displacement block internally;
selected returned rows do not imply that all internal vectors are selected.

Reactions use the actual assembled case load in `K u - F`. Per-case
`constraint_forces` separates support reactions, MPC slave forces, master
equivalent forces and nullspace diagnostics. Selected reaction requests omit the
full residual vector and filter physical node buckets; `reaction_node_ids`
declares their stable requested scope, including nodes with zero compact-map
entries. `EnvelopeReducer.update_batch` consumes these records and preserves
governing case identities.

`constraint_mode="auto"` preserves physical free-free load compatibility.
Incompatible loads raise `StaticBatchError`. Explicit
`allow_unbalanced_free_free=True` returns the existing gauged solution with
balancing generalized reactions and warnings. Multipliers, gauge residuals and
per-case backward errors are reported. Session-backed single-case free-free
solves reuse the augmented factor. The collecting API also accepts the explicit
`solve_linear_many(..., constraint_mode="nullspace")` route; its existing
supported/auto behavior remains available. An explicit `factorization_cache`
remains caller-owned in this route. If a session is also supplied, the cache
must be that session's cache; conflicting cache arguments raise `ValueError`.
`AnalysisSession(model, factorization_cache=cache)` can share that same cache
explicitly, and closing the session does not release caller-owned handles.

Input iteration, callbacks and yields hold no solver authority lease. Structural
model changes terminate the stream; normal load registration and load updates
remain permitted. Internally created sessions and source iterators close on
exhaustion, failure, cancellation or generator close. A supplied session remains
caller-owned. Cleanup preserves a primary failure when iterator close also fails.

`ResourceConfig.memory_limit_bytes` limits a conservative storage estimate and
adapts the requested block size; it refuses a request that cannot fit one case.
This is an allocation estimate, not an operating-system RSS cap. Native sparse
factor storage and arbitrary provider allocations remain estimates. Diagnostics
include effective block size, phase timings and process-wide monotonic backend
operation counts/deltas. Concurrent unrelated backend work affects those deltas.
Solver native pools, assembly Numba workers and recovery workers use the separate
`ResourceConfig` limits. Each operation restores its thread policy before input
iteration, callbacks and yields, including failure and early close paths.

Only certified blocks are yielded. A later failed block does not invalidate
already yielded responses. Callers should consume blocks incrementally and close
the iterator when stopping early; collecting all blocks retains all collected
outputs. Exact component superposition, nonlinear derived stress recomputation
and response-basis APIs are separate contracts and are not inferred from time
labels or implemented by this iterator.
