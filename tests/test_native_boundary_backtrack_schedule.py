"""Call-path regression for the finite backtrack schedule near advisory events.

Drives the real FinitePointDriver._solve_fixed backtrack loop with mocked
assembly, advance and publication, so the trial schedule, budget accounting
and commit behaviour are observed on the actual call path rather than an
extracted helper. The mocked owner selects the native-material boundary gate
(owner._bl5_native_material) that admits the advisory first-event probe.
