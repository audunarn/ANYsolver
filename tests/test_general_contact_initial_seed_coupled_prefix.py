"""Coupled 2x2 initial-contact-seed prefix: enabled outcome on real mechanics.

The existing small-patch driver fixture is used unchanged: the 2x2 Q4
source against the two-S3 nonmatching target, 20um initial normal gap,
0.04 N two-step interior nodal force ramp, unchanged 50um gap budget,
joint overlap certificate explicitly effective, D1/Jet2/fine-Q1/
monolithic/primal-mortar route. The only difference from the banked
default-none witness is the initial_contact_seed selector; mechanics,
program, tolerances and every acceptance gate are identical.

Measured fact that shapes this module (attempt-05 of this scope, same
immutable source snapshot): ONE real half solve of this fixture costs
~167 s under the guard's serial NUMBA_DISABLE_JIT=1 environment and the
default-none reference half terminates with status 'diverged' — the
first-ever completed execution of this prefix (every earlier campaign
job was killed by its cap mid-solve). Two half solves therefore cannot
fit one 180 s job, so the seedNone-vs-enabled comparison is banked
across attempts: the default-none outcome is attempt-05's evidence, and
this module records the enabled outcome truthfully. No acceleration or
nonlinear feasibility is assumed: the seed outcome (admitted or
refused, with counts, reason and cost) and the trajectory outcome are
both recorded as they occur. Only if the prefix becomes available is
the COMPLETE accepted public checkpoint exported under the attempt TEMP
directory for later connected macro rollback/restart checks; no
internal Newton checkpoint is ever exported.
