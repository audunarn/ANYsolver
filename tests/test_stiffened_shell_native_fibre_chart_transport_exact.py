"""Exact native fibre chart transport parity; scoped development only.

This pins the two lifecycle invariants the cyclic chart-energy comparison
relies on, at byte level:

1. A shell chart rebase carries the accepted fibre material and energy
   records through unchanged (no recomputation at the chart event).
2. A chart checkpoint round-trip reproduces the rebased branch's accepted
   increments bit-for-bit: identical accepted results and identical
   checkpoint bytes after every increment.

It deliberately does NOT compare against a non-rebased control branch and is
not a qualification of the control-vs-rebase energy parity tolerance.
