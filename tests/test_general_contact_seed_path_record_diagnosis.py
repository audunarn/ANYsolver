"""One parameterized literal-record diagnosis at the actual seed refusal.

Scope: D1_SEED_PATH_ADMISSION_DELIVERY_DEV600_V1 (Mistral-owned slice).

The independent stdlib-only reference (scripts/general_contact_seed_gap_reference.py,
extended in this slice with the ten-record capture loader, exact rational
string exports, end-pose gap-definition distinction and chart/budget
inconclusive refusal classification) certifies each of the ten literal
capture records (2 endpoint + 8 path witnesses, sha256-bound to the original
capture artifact). The unchanged production stage chain is then evaluated
per record with the exact production schedules and the per-record refusing
stage is located. All raw evidence is written incrementally to the guard's
unique TEMP directory; assertions here are structural invariants of the
enclosures only, never admission decisions.
