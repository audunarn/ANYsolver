"""Focused F2 eligibility discrimination and truthful example prose.

The independent review (F2) suspected a silently ignored seed selection on
routes that pass validation: the runtime selection drops the seed to None
without refusal when friction is declared or when the validated profile is
not the refined Q4/S3 overlap-local one. This module closes both halves
with real production calls, no solve and no new scientific admission:

- Friction half: every friction route conflicts with the seed-pinned
  settings, and the path entry now refuses the enabled seed with friction
  explicitly (fail closed) before any route preparation, mirroring the
  driver-level refusal pattern. The check uses a real friction settings
  object on the coupled fixture.
- Profile half: the Q4/Q4-monolithic profile requires
  ``jet2_q4_q4_dev``, which the enabled seed forbids; a definition with a
  Q4 target face is refused by real validation with the enabled seed, and
  the fixture's own validating route selects exactly the seed-eligible
  overlap-local profile. No silently skipped profile shape validates.

It also pins the example's prose truth: the coupled example is UNVERIFIED
to completion and its source-bound checks are not installed testing.
