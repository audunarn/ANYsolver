"""Nonlinear/contact reliability tests for the standard edge beam-shell routes.

The three standard attachment routes (shared beam/shell node IDs, one-to-one
eccentric MPC, interpolated edge MPC) are exercised together with the
qualified planar rigid-plane penalty contact profile
(``PLANAR_Q4_RIGID_PLANE_PENALTY_MORTAR_V1``) on a qualified Q4 cantilever
with a standard ``BeamElement`` along the free shell edge.  Contact acts only
on the shell.  The coupling keeps the existing exact fixed-reference MPC law
with the single common offset ``r`` and no penalty coupling; von Karman
small-rotation kinematics are used for the lifecycle and restart solves.

Fixture contract (fixed before running):

- The successful small-rotation cycle and restart fixtures use a rigid plane
  at the reference shell midsurface ``z = 0`` (the admitted plane-fixture
  configuration of the existing plane module's guided-plate restart), gap
  tolerance 0.001, contact stiffness 1e5 and press force 0.1 per beam node.
  The root lies on the plane: an open accepted state may therefore report
  ``minimum_gap == 0`` at the supported root, but must carry zero active
  pressure/force and a positive free-edge gap.  Accepted rotations are
  explicitly bounded by ``MAX_ACCEPTED_ROTATION = 0.01`` rad.
- The deliberately rejected-trial fixture and the manufactured derivative
  states keep the separated plane ``z = -0.04`` with the same tolerance, so
  the firmly open/closed finite-difference base is unchanged.

Checks in this module:

- the production reduced force/tangent scatter
  (``nonlinear_reduced_assembly.assemble_reduced_system`` through a real
  constraint transformation ``T``) equals the explicit pullback of the
  production full assembly, for every route including an algebraic
  extrapolation compatibility control with negative weights (1.4, -0.4)
  outside the Q4 edge; on-edge quadratic negative-weight coverage already
  exists in the standard transfer tests and is not duplicated here;
- independent central differences of the production reduced internal force
  ``T^T F_int`` (the quantity whose equilibrium against ``T^T F_ext`` forms
  the actual Newton residual) at firmly open and firmly closed contact
  states, in translation, rotation and mixed retained directions that
  activate the lever arm and the shape weights.  The three perturbation
  sizes below are locked before running:

      PERTURBATION_SIZES = (1e-4, 1e-5, 1e-6)
      LENGTH_SCALE       = 1.0    m   (panel edge)
      ROTATION_SCALE    = 1.0    rad (small-rotation scale)

  The scaled tangent error must stay <= 1e-6 at the two smallest adjacent
  sizes.  No evaluation differentiates across a contact branch: every
  perturbed evaluation re-checks the active-pressure count, the minimum-gap
  branch margin and the penalty energy against its base state, and the
  committed state mapping is deep-copied, explicitly restored around every
  +/- evaluation and verified unchanged;
- one public ``NonlinearLoadProgram`` press/release/recontact cycle per
  route on a single model: every accepted increment snapshot is checked for
  its load-stage factors, MPC map, contact branch and equilibrium from the
  actual nonlinear internal + contact force against the staged external load
  (never tangent-times-u); the committed stage endpoints are closed, open
  (exactly zero contact force, positive free-edge gap) and closed again, and
  the final state reproduces the press-only reference;
- actual virtual work through the production ``T`` and the MPC wrench
  transfer about a common origin from the accepted pressed state: the
  per-slave out-of-balance force/couple (including the applied beam load)
  transfers to the masters exactly as the analytic sum
  ``N_i [F, M + r x F]``, with nonzero force and couple required, and the
  nonlinear support-reaction bucket closes global equilibrium without
  double counting;
- a deliberately rejected trial (``contact_gap_exceeded``) retains exactly
  the last accepted snapshot/checkpoint state and that state re-evaluates
  as an equilibrium; mid-solve cancellation fires only after one observed
  accepted increment (progress event ``nonlinear_static_step``), leaves the
  captured state owner with no active trial, unchanged generation and
  payload equal to the accepted baseline, and the SAME model then solves
  to the clean reference; callback failure leaves the contact scope
  discarded and a fresh solve reproduces the reference;
- split restart versus uninterrupted solve (rtol 1e-8 / atol 1e-10).  With
  the plane at the reference midsurface the half-load state is already
  closed; the actual branch is inspected and compared with the first
  committed increment of the uninterrupted path instead of claiming a
  closure crossing.  A legitimate aliased weight or offset update rejects
  the checkpoint before any new Newton work.

The finite-rotation MPC restriction is preserved unchanged: the finite
contact path in ``general_contact/static_path.py`` refuses weighted MPC rows,
repeated selector columns and nonzero reference offsets before assembly
("finite shell path requires zero-offset selector constraints without MPC
rows").  This module reviews that guard statically and executes no finite
programme; no finite-rotation attachment development is performed here.

Dimensionless identity residuals are bounded by 1e-10 against the explicit
scales stated below.
