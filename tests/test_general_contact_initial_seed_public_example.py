"""Public example check: the initial-contact-seed example runs end to end.

The owned example ``examples/general_contact_initial_contact_seed_dev.py``
is executed as a real public entry point against the guard's immutable
source snapshot (derived from the attempt's ``install.json``; the
repository ``src`` tree is the fallback outside the guard). The example
reports its trajectory truthfully and exits 0 exactly when the accepted
prefix completes, so this check verifies that contract: valid JSON on
stdout with the effective seed selection and the full seed record
(outcome, counts, refusal reason, cost), and an exit code consistent
with the reported status. No acceleration or nonlinear feasibility is
assumed; the physical outcome is recorded as it occurs.

Measured timing context (this scope): one real half solve of this
fixture costs 167 s (default-none, attempt-05, terminated 'diverged')
and the seeded run was still executing at the 180 s cap (attempt-06),
so completing this check needs a fresh allowance with a longer cap.
