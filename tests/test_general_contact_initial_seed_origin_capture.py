"""Real-origin seed proposal capture on the coupled 2x2 fixture.

The full seeded half prefix cannot fit any guard cap: one real half
solve of this fixture measures 167 s (default-none, attempt-05 of this
scope, terminated 'diverged') and the seeded run was still executing at
the 180 s cap (attempt-06). This module instead captures the production
seed proposal at the REAL committed origin of the SAME fixture and
mechanics: the wrapper calls the real ``propose_linearized_kkt_seed``
with the production blocks (constrained structural tangent, full
supported normalized-gap gradients, live residual and constraint) and
then raises ``SolveCancelled`` — the proven-propagating channel — so
the solve stops after one origin tangent evaluation, before any Newton
work, with the origin untouched.

The capture records truthfully whether the reference-linearized KKT
operator admits a nonnegative supported pressure proposal at the real
cold-start origin, with the refusal reason, operator/evaluation counts
and cost, and the predicted versus actual gap/support structure. No
acceptance gate is evaluated here and no trajectory claim is made.
