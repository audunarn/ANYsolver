"""Static public-example contract: model, route, seed wiring, fixture parity.

The end-to-end execution of the example (one real coupled half solve) is
executed by the sibling public-example subprocess check, not here. This
module verifies the example's static public contract on the same
immutable snapshot: the built model/settings/program are the fixture's
D1 overlap-local route, the default-none selector keeps the legacy
shape, and the enabled selector is admitted by real validation on the
example's own model. It also pins the focused physical parity demanded
by this delivery: the example's independently constructed fixture IS
the root-adopted 4x4 Q4 resolution candidate of the restart's
small-patch driver - identical physical node coordinates, element
connectivity and shell thickness, materials, perimeter/lateral/target
supports, contact definition, effective settings and two-step -0.04 N
ramp program, with the remapped load node 13 at (.6,.6) and ux anchors
1 and 11 at (.1,.1)/(.1,.6) asserted against the actual mesh
coordinates. The example file itself imports nothing from the tests
tree; only this test-side check imports the driver fixture. No solve
is executed here and no trajectory claim is made.
