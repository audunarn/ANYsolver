"""Controlled yield-boundary tangent-selection comparison for cyclic fibre charts.

Cross-chart cyclic comparison of recovered native physical fibre records.
Every selected tangent/branch is re-verified against the actual unchanged
constitutive law and the record's own captured accepted predecessor. Two
verification routes exist, per record:

- Exact reconstruction (independent counterexample units): when the
  recorded station strain pairs reproduce the law's fibre strain exactly
  (Decimal prec 80, the product response's own fibre map and summation
  order), the recorded recovery must be precisely the law's output and
  the captured accepted history must be exactly the predecessor plus the
  recorded increment.
- Exact local cell replay (actual cell-recovery captures): recover_material
  invokes the deterministic coupled cell response once per fibre beam -
  cell.response(p18, accepted predecessor, include_energy=True) on the
  retained resultants p18 - and the underlying cell computes the station
  strain as a Decimal80 value, publishes pair(strain) per component and
  constructs the FibreRecovery from the exact Decimal80 fibre strain, so
  every published pair loses the 80-digit tail and no reconstruction from
  the pairs can re-derive the law's inputs or outputs. When the caller
  supplies the capture's actual retained-fibre operators (cell_operators),
  the comparator re-runs that same deterministic response from the
  capture's own retained resultants and accepted predecessor rows and
  requires every recorded station field, fibre record, accepted history
  row and energy record to be exactly its output - the true inputs, never
  the rounded station pairs. This is local constitutive replay only: no
  global equilibrium is solved and no acceptance criterion is claimed
  here. Compensated operators and malformed captures are refused with a
  precise obstruction rather than dropping verification.

The earlier derived representation-error interval route was removed after
the root review rejected its proof: strain-unit pads were added to stress
rounding bounds, the yield-boundary pin solved the wrong equation
(radius/E - z0 instead of z0 + radius/E, excluding valid negative
boundaries and nonzero accepted plastic strain), and a heuristic 32-ULP
margin stood in for directed rounding. It is preserved verbatim in
.restart-ci/chart-comparison-delivery/interval-route-04-preserved.py.

Equality stays required on smooth and same-branch selections through the
existing 1e-9 physical comparator; only a pair whose own signed yield
functions straddle zero (opposing signs, or an exact zero on one side, on
the same hardening segment) AND whose selected branches are an elastic-side
selection against a plastic-side selection, or a valid ELASTIC vs
YIELD_BOUNDARY pair, may report the two valid one-sided tangents. No
surface-distance band, no hardening-knot exemption (a HARDENING_KNOT
selection never pairs with a different branch), no forged labels. No
solver runs, no product APIs, no constitutive change; physical 1e-9
state/energy scales and exact reset/restored checks elsewhere are
untouched. Historical failures stay immutable.
