"""Probe-window small-step acceptance at coupled backtrack exhaustion.

The coupled probe already pays for one fully evaluated candidate at its
fixed small distance. When strong local curvature makes every geometric
cut overshoot the merit descent window, that measured sample can be the
only decreasing candidate. These tests pin the production routing of the
window acceptance inside the real ``_solve_fixed`` backtrack loop: strict
measured decrease only, per-iteration staleness protection, cancellation
observation, truthful work accounting and no partial commit. The mocked
owner follows tests/test_stiffened_shell_coupled_predictor_accounting.py;
no fixture loads or defaults are exercised here.
