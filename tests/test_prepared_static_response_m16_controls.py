"""M16 negative controls: measure what relative error the frozen assessment detects.

First version (evidence m16-claude-05-controls) assumed a 1e-11 relative error
would be detected in derived measures; it was not (linear 124 detections,
derived 0). That failure is preserved. This version measures the detection
threshold for each criterion instead of assuming it. Criteria are unchanged.
