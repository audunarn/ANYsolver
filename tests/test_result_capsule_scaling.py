"""Focused development tests for capsule export layout-signature scaling.

The stored-row bookkeeping must stay compact for many cases: one immutable
signature object per layout revision shared by every stored row of that
revision, an indexed entity-id -> size lookup, and no numeric payload
retained after the sink has consumed it.
