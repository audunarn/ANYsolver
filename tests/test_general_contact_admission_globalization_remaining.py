"""Remaining admission/globalization caller/public checks plus one adversarial
physical-normal witness case.

Owner module for the v5 narrowed repair: the sixteen unaffected passed witness
math checks are NOT rerun here. This module imports only the nine remaining
caller/public test functions from the witness-public module (parameter markers
counted) after the capped-matching spy repair, and adds one genuinely
adversarial physical-normal case where the target-plane height exceeds the gap
tolerance but the actual physical source-normal gap does not, so a
target-plane-height criterion would falsely refuse and the physical witness
must not.
