"""Phase/cost probe for the 4x4 driver fixture under the guard environment.

Attempt-01 showed that one real 2x2 macro step does not complete inside a
60 s job under NUMBA_DISABLE_JIT=1. This probe does not change any
production mechanic: it wraps the certificate/report/increment entry points
with call-through timing recorders and only if the half solve actually
finishes asserts the same explicit fixture gates (completed single step
with real active contact). The recorders are installed through a
scope-managed monkeypatch context and the log is closed in a finally, so
an exception from the instrumented solve leaves the production hooks
restored and the log file closed; the recurring faulthandler thread was
removed because the external run_focused supervisor already captures
bounded time/stack artifacts. The log file is the evidence; no per-solve
timing is invented from a timeout.
