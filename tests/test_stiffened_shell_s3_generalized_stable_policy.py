"""Narrow elastic S3 stable-translation policy for the generalized point owner.

The plain S3 generalized POINT owner reuses the existing
cancellation-resistant elastic S3 deformation: same equations, tolerances and
actual derivative maps, selected privately at construction. Old checkpoints
keep their original arithmetic explicitly; the existing stable native schema,
history packing and shape validation are reused without format changes.
