"""Partial propagation-only driver evidence on the flat 2x2 fixture.

The six authored driver checks each need multiple completed real solves.
Under the guard's NUMBA_DISABLE_JIT=1 environment one 2x2 half solve
measures roughly 80-110 s of real work (attempt-03 phase log: macro
attempt stagnation refusal at 14.2 s, then adaptive dyadic substep
trials at 11.3/2.0/14.7/7.4/2.1 s and still running at the 60 s job
cap), so no restore-vs-reference half can execute inside the remaining
allowance. This module banks only the propagation halves that do fit:
the declared injected first-refusal reaches the real cutback, a
cancellation token at the first continuation safe point propagates
SolveCancelled with no substep Newton published, and a cancellation
token at the first semismooth iteration safe point propagates through
the macro attempt. Restore correctness against a pristine reference
remains unverified; these are partial checks, not the six authored
driver checks.
